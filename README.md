Staffed by developers, entrepreneurs and Bitcoin experts who have been involved in the cryptocurrency space since Bitcoin's very early beginnings, we aim to be a one stop hub for all things Bitcoin related.

With onsite Bitcoin ATM, band stage, talks platform, shop and a dedicated Bitcoin art gallery, BrightBlock will be a thriving space of creativity and collaboration where we will hold regular events and welcome newcomers on a daily basis who are keen to understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in more depth.
