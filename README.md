## Introduction

A decentralised platform for buying and selling and auctioning art using Bitcoin.

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Purpose

This is a proposal for a new kind of social market place for art where artists and art lovers can trade directly in a middle man free environment and in a community that supports artists and creators. We believe a fully decentralised application in this sector based on bitcoin consensus network will have wide appeal and will benefit from positive network effects at the grass roots level.

Our first goal is to build a provenance solution that is capable of registering and transferring digital and physical works of art with immutable and secure proofs of ownership. We will then build on this foundation by providing direct seller to buyer  transactions registered on the bitcoin blockchain with transfer of ownership records. As the market place grows we will build a new kind of decentralised auction functionality which enables curators to set up and run auctions within their communities.

Our platform will incentivise a community of artists and art lovers from the ground up with governance, reputation and reward structures under the control of the community because we believe this is the only way to disrupt the vested interests of the online art world.
